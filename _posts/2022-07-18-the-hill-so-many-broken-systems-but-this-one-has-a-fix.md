[Hana Schank](https://hanaschank.com/) and I have [an op-ed in The Hill today](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3561165-so-many-broken-systems-but-this-one-has-a-fix/) about about the positive impact federal shared digital services and other forms of federal help for state-administered programs could have on the timeliness, cost, and end user's experience.

As I've [mentioned recently](https://aaronsnow.net/2022/05/09/sharing-federal-digital-services-with-other-layers-of-government.html) I'm a big believer that when creating new programs that states will be expected to implement, the federal government can and should do more than just send cash stapled to policy requirements. My [BeeckCenter](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu) co-Fellow [Shelby Switzer](https://shelbyswitzer.com/) is, too --- and they [wrote this terrific piece about it recently](https://civicunrest.com/2022/06/14/the-shift-to-servant-leadership) at [Civic Unrest](https://civicunrest.com).
