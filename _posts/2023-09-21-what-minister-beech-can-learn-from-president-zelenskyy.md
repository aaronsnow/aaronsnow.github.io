I have an Op-Ed in Ottawa Citizen today, about [how Canada's new Citizen Services ministry can benefit from one ally's resounding success in becoming a truly digital government](https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/snow-what-canada-can-learn-from-ukraine-about-digital-services-for-citizens).

Tl;dr: The success of Ukraine's government app, [Diia](https://www.usaid.gov/diiaindc), isn't about the war or the pandemic. It's about the commitment the Zelenskyy government made early on to putting "the state in a smartphone," and how they manifested that commitment, not just in words, but in their organization and authorities, their budget and laws.
