The DOL today released [open source sample code](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/ui-modernization#sample-code) for implementing important pieces of the unemployment insurance systems they require states to implement. I am overjoyed. This is important, valuable precedent for changing how the federal government supports the policies it leaves to the states to implement. (See the last couple paragraphs of my [post about this very subject](https://aaronsnow.net/2022/05/09/sharing-federal-digital-services-with-other-layers-of-government.html).)

Moreover, a second lede is folded into this code launch: some of the released sample code enables states to use [login.gov](https://login.gov) as an identity proofing provider, with Arkansas leading the way as the pilot case. Login.gov having its first state-level client is a huge step for federal shared services.
