I'm Aaron. 
I'm currently a [Faculty Fellow](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/person/aaron-snow/) at the [Georgetown University Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu). 
From 2018-2021 I was the first CEO of the [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca). 
Before that, I was Executive Director and co-founder of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov). 

For more, you can find me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/aaronsnow) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aaronsnow), or sometimes [Threads](https://threads.net/aaronfromcleveland).

I'm also trying out a newsletter. You can [subscribe to it here](https://buttondown.email/aaronsnow).
