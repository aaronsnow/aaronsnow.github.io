I'm Aaron. I'm currently an advisor with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), helping governments around the world on their digital transformation journeys.

I've built and led digital service teams for two governments. In 2014 I co-founded and then led [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), the US government’s in-house technology and design consultancy, and helped create and was the first Deputy Commissioner of the [Technology Transformation Service](https://tts.gsa.gov/). From 2018-2021 I was the first CEO of the Government of Canada’s [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca/).

I got my start working on government technology in 2013 as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://pif.gov). Before entering government service, I developed software and managed product development for small and large enterprises, including Microsoft, and co-founded Daring Software, building the back-end for its flagship [Arro](https://web.archive.org/web/20151031205146/http://www.arroapp.com/) shopping app.

Most recently, I was a [Faculty Fellow](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/person/aaron-snow/) at the [Georgetown University Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu). I'm also on the [FWD50](https://fwd50.com) Advisory Board and the Board of Directors of the [Foundation for Public Code North America](https://publiccode.net).
